# Project Name: Optimizing Python Code using Alternate Functions
This project is aimed at finding faster alternatives to Python code by utilizing existing libraries and alternate functions. The project uses a Large Language Model, ChatGPT, to retrieve and generate runnable code snippets and benchmarks them for various input sizes.

# Motivation
Python is a popular programming language used for a variety of applications, from web development to machine learning. However, Python code is often criticized for its slow performance compared to other languages such as C. This project aims to optimize Python code by exploring alternate functions available in existing libraries.

#Features
* Retrieve a list of functions from an existing Python library, such as NumPy.
* Use ChatGPT to generate runnable code snippets for each function in the library.
* Benchmarks the original function against the generated alternate function for various input sizes.
* Presents the results in a graphical format to compare the performance of the original function and the alternate function.


# Tech Stack
* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* OpenAI's GPT-3.5
